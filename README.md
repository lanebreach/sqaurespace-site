# Squarespace Assets
This repo contains assets and code used on our squarespace website. For example, we rely on embedded html/js to display our mapbox map.

## Contributing
 Make sure that any changes made to embedded code eventually are reflected in this repo. We will zero in on an 
 organizational structure as time goes on, please use your best judgement until then.
